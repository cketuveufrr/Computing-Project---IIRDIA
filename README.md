# Computing Project - IIRDIA
 Computing Project. Goal is to implement E. Loems Master's Thesis for ulterior work. 

## Hardware Setup

This project is designed to work with:
- Sphero RVR robots
- IRIDIA's custom configuration:
    - 2x Raspberry Pi 4
    - TeraRanger distance sensors
    - YDLidar X4 for mapping
